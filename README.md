## Functionality overview

The application I used is a social blogging site called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can access it here: https://angular.realworld.io

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU\* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
